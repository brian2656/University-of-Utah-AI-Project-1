*Objective: Determine if there's any correlation between population growth, migration, when there's conflict around the world*

*Resources: datasets from [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/) used in this project include "conflict_data.csv", "net_migration.csv", and "population.csv" located in the 'Resources' folder within this repository.*

* Project Overview:  Find the effect conflicts had on net migration for Rwanda, Afghanistan, Mexico, Iraq, Syria, Eritrea, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Columbia, and regions/continents such as Middle East, Europe, Africa, and Asia.
Graph the conflict data, and also the data for the population changes, for each country.
Provide a summary analysis for the specific conflict events that impacted the overall population/migration.*


* In conclusion, the analysis of population, net migration, and conflict deaths datasets across specific countries from 1989 to 2021 revealed migration patterns that seem to be influenced by various factors, not just conflict related deaths. While countries like Rwanda, Syria, and Bosnia displayed a strong negative correlation between conflict deaths and net migration, indicating significant outward migration in response to conflict, Mexico emerged as an exception with a moderate positive correlation. This highlights the complexity of migration patterns and the multitude of factors influencing migration decisions, beyond conflict alone. Further research is warranted to explore the unique contextual factors shaping migration dynamics in each country and region, as well as to identify additional exceptions to observed trends.*
